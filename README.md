# Umbraco storage providers

This repository contains Umbraco storage providers that can replace the default physical file storage.

## Umbraco.StorageProviders.AzureBlob

The Azure Blob Storage provider has an implementation of the Umbraco `IFileSystem` that connects to an Azure Blob Storage container.

It also has the following features:
- middleware for serving media files from the `/media` path
- ImageSharp image provider/cache
- a CDN media URL provider

### Usage

This provider can be added in the `Startup.cs` file:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddUmbraco(_env, _config)
        .AddBackOffice()
        .AddWebsite()
        .AddComposers()
        // Add the Azure Blob Storage file system, ImageSharp image provider/cache and middleware for Media:
        .AddAzureBlobMediaFileSystem() 
        // Optionally add the CDN media URL provider:
        .AddCdnMediaUrlProvider()
        .Build();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }

    app.UseUmbraco()
        .WithMiddleware(u =>
        {
            u.UseBackOffice();
            u.UseWebsite();
            // Enables the Azure Blob Storage middleware for Media:
            u.UseAzureBlobMediaFileSystem();

        })
        .WithEndpoints(u =>
        {
            u.UseInstallerEndpoints();
            u.UseBackOfficeEndpoints();
            u.UseWebsiteEndpoints();
        });
}
```

There're multiple ways to configure the provider, it can be done in code:

```csharp
services.AddUmbraco(_env, _config)

    .AddAzureBlobMediaFileSystem(options => {
        options.ConnectionString = "";
        options.ContainerName = "";
    })

    .AddCdnMediaUrlProvider(options => {
        options.Url = new Uri("https://my-cdn.example.com/");
    });

```

In `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Umbraco": {
    "Storage": {
      "AzureBlob": {
        "Media": {
          "ConnectionString": "",
          "ContainerName": "",
          "Cdn": {
            "Url": ""
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or by environment variables:

```sh
UMBRACO__STORAGE__AZUREBLOB__MEDIA__CONNECTIONSTRING=<CONNECTION_STRING>
UMBRACO__STORAGE__AZUREBLOB__MEDIA__CONTAINERNAME=<CONTAINER_NAME>
UMBRACO__STORAGE__AZUREBLOB__MEDIA__CDN__URL=<CDN_BASE_URL>
```

_Note: you still have to add the provider in the `Startup.cs` file when not configuring the options in code._

### Folder structure in the Azure Blob Storage container
The container name is expected to exist and uses the following folder structure:
- `/media` - contains the Umbraco media, stored in the structure defined by the `IMediaPathScheme` registered in Umbraco (the default `UniqueMediaPathScheme` stores files with their original filename in 8 character directories, based on the content and property GUID identifier)
- `/cache` - contains the ImageSharp image cache, stored as files with a filename defined by the `ICacheHash` registered in ImageSharp (the default `CacheHash` generates SHA256 hashes of the file contents and uses the first characters configured by the `Umbraco:CMS:Imaging:CachedNameLength` setting)

Note that this is different than the behavior of other file system providers - i.e. https://github.com/umbraco-community/UmbracoFileSystemProviders.Azure that expect the media contents to be at the root level.

## Using the file system providers
